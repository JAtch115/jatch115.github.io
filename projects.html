                        DTMB Course Registration is a project that I worked on as an intern at the State of Michigan Department of Technology Management and Budget.
                        I worked with two other interns in an angile environment to create a web application that allows State of Michigan employees to register for training courses or events.
                        We created detailed diagrams for the class and database structure as well as functional design documents and systems design documents. The entire project empasized State of Michigan design standards as well as ADA compliance.
                        The application was created using ASP.NET and utilizing HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, ASP.NET Razor, ASP.NET MVC, SQL Server 2012, and Microsoft Active Directory for the Log-ins.
                        It allows users to register for courses or events, see upcoming courses or events, and give feedback for courses or events that they have already attended.

                        Marcole Installation Wizard is a project that I worked on as an intern at Marcole Interactive Systems. This projects was to create an installation wizard for Marcole software.
                        This application is written entirely in Java so that it would be able to be used on many different platforms. The user is able to agree to the license agreement, enter their
                        license information from Marcole, and select where they would like the installer to install the software. This project also included writing detailed documentation for the user
                        so that they are able to make sure they can use the software correctly.

                        Sequential URL Downloader is a side project that I worked on. Whenever I had the need to download many sequentially named files I realized that I did not have a tool that could
                        efficiently accomplish what I needed. I decided to create my own application to solve this problem. The Sequential URL Downloader allows the user to enter the base URL of the file,
                        the range of numbers that they want to download, and the file type extension. The tool creates a list of URLs, checks to see if they file is available, then prompts the user for the
                        location on their computer that they want to download the files to. The application is written in C# using Visual Basic 2017.
